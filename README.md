# Monster Shop Extensions - Bulk Discount
This project was a solo project in our final week during Module 2 of my time at Turing School of Software and Design. The main goal was to use an app that we had been working on for a few weeks in order to implement a feature for merchants to be able to create, read, update/edit and delete a discount for specific item(s). The app can be viewed here: [Monster Shop Final](https://monster-shop-final-proj.herokuapp.com/), or it can be viewed from your own local computer. In order to clone the project onto your own computer, please follow the instructions bellow;
